                <h2>Lessons from going it on my own</h2>

                    What seemed hopeless yesterday, even this morning, seems a lot less hopeless now. There are many things that are hard about coding, and not all of them are about mind-boggling errors. It is hard to leave the computer when you have a problem you can't just work out, but that's what needs to be done. It's amazing how easy it is to forget that you've been in the same situation lots of times before, when you've been stuck in a spot that seemed impossible to get through, but then you did and then you moved on to the next thing. But you do fix the problem, and then you move on. It make not take the time you want it to take, but it can be done. And there is progress. Don't be disheartened.

                    One thing I've learned as I make my own ruby gem is that it is important to know what to copy from others and what to develop completely on your own. When you use someone else's code, it's important to remember that it's not part of an organic process you went through on your own, which much of programming apparently is.</p>
