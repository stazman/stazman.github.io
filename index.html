                    A lot of things that I used to see in my ESL students I see now in myself. And a lot of the things that I know we're good for teaching and learning ESL are also good for learning coding. Even though there are a lot of things that are similar and a new language to the language you already know, it is easy to think of yourself as an outsider and because you are foreign to it that actually hurts you from using what you already know and have learned about the new thing. In ESL teaching that is known as the affective filter. And now when it feels like I haven't learned anything I know that actually I've learned a lot. And like I used to tell my students it takes time to learn a language. And programming is definitely not any easier than that. It involves not just learning pieces of information and memorizing them but also new ways of thinking new kinds of logic. And now I'm finding that what I used to tell students is what I need to be following myself now. Learning programming takes time like learning a new language. Also, sometimes the only way that you can learn some aspects of language is through actually practicing it. And that's a lot of the way it is with learning programming. Some things you can copy, some things you can learn from as examples but in the end you really need to practice it on your own. In language learning we have something called chunks of language such as phrases like how's it going? It's really don't make sense literally in terms of what you're supposed to respond to and their purpose in a conversation. I'm asking how well are you with that not how something is making motion. And the it just stands for or you can look at it like the it just stands for your day or your feelings or your life but it's still understood when you speak you don't say those things you just use the word it. So it's a chunk. It doesn't necessarily mean something literally directly. And that's how code is. You can learn something about code but until you see it practiced and try to practice yourself you're not really going to fully understand it or as we say and language teaching it will not be uptake. It will not be automatic.

                    What seemed hopeless yesterday, even this morning, seems a lot less hopeless now. There are many things that are hard about coding, and not all of them are about mind-boggling errors. It is hard to leave the computer when you have a problem you can't just work out, but that's what needs to be done. It's amazing how easy it is to forget that you've been in the same situation lots of times before, when you've been stuck in a spot that seemed impossible to get through, but then you did and then you moved on to the next thing. But you do fix the problem, and then you move on. It make not take the time you want it to take, but it can be done. And there is progress. Don't be disheartened.

                    One thing I've learned as I make my own ruby gem is that it is important to know what to copy from others and what to develop completely on your own. When you use someone else's code, it's important to remember that it's not part of an organic process you went through on your own, which much of programming apparently is.</p>
